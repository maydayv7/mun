          The MUN, or the Model United Nations, is a simulation of the actual
          UN. The participants pretend to represent a nation, and come to
          together to discuss the very same issues being debated upon in the UN.
          This gives a normal person the opportunity to know what’s its like to
          stand for something more than himself/herself, and to experience the
          complicated the verbal dance and that politicians and delegates take
          part in everyday. The MUN is a conclave for ideation by the fresh
          minds of our nation, to brainstorm solutions to problems plaguing our
          world. Participants work through the tenuous relationships between
          nations as they deliberate towards a resolution – and they get to look
          nice in a suit and tie while they do it!
